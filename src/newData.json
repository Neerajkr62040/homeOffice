Time constraints: Mitigate time constraints by carefully planning the testing schedule, identifying critical paths, and allocating resources effectively. Changing requirements: Implement a robust change management process to handle changing requirements, ensuring that changes are documented, communicated, and incorporated into the test plan as needed. Lack of expertise: Address this challenge by providing training to team members, leveraging external expertise if necessary, and ensuring that the team has the necessary skills to execute the test plan effectively.",

Smoke testing is a broad test of the entire system to ensure that it is stable enough for more detailed testing. It is typically performed after a new build is received and focuses on major functionalities. If the smoke test fails, it indicates that the build is too unstable for further testing and needs to be fixed before additional testing can be performed. Sanity testing, on the other hand, is a narrow and deep test that focuses on specific areas of functionality that are most likely to have been affected by recent changes. It is performed after smoke testing and aims to verify that specific issues have been addressed. Sanity testing helps ensure that the most critical aspects of the software are working correctly before more extensive testing is conducted.",
